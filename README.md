# car-parking-game
As part of my a-level coursework, I created this parking game which included menu screens, multiple levels, car selection options and music in Java using the Greenfoot IDE.

## How I made it:
Used: Java
Ide: Greenfoot
Using agile development processes, I created this game from scratch from the research and idea making stage to creating a complete project. The full documentation can be found in the project. I began by creating the menu screens which had multiple buttons that went to different "backgrounds", this includes a sound button to mute the music, as well as buttons to a "how-to screen" and car selection.

The car selection included different cars which could be selected and played with on the levels. The first level included obstacles such as another moving vehicle, safety cones to prevent going off the edge, grass curbs, potholes and pedestrians. The aim is to go through the tunnel at the end of the first screen and end up in the second screen, which had the final car park space.
The second level has a roundabout with a car moving around it to avoid, as well as a more tricky parallel park.

## Problems
Even after my final result, there were some problems. The car selection would not alway work and would sometimes require loading the level again before the car colour would change. </br>
There was also an unexplained problem where the program would sometimes break after hitting too many objects, such as the code. 
This can all be viewed in my final run through the link below.

## Project Status
As this was mainly for coursework purposes, this project is mainly complete. If I were to go back to it I would attempt to fix the bugs and add further components such as a money system for buying cars and minigames, as well as further levels.
